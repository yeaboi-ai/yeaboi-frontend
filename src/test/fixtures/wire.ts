/**
 * The drift guard between `types/board.ts` and what the server actually sends.
 *
 * The JSON beside this file is not hand-written. `tests/unit/test_web_wire_shapes.py`
 * drives a real `RetroBoard` and a real `PokerBoard` through a real round, and
 * renders a real slide deck and every static export from real artifacts, then
 * writes the results here and fails if what it wrote differs from what is
 * committed. This file is the other half: each fixture `satisfies` the interface
 * the bundle is coded against, so `npm run typecheck` fails when Python stops
 * sending a field the TypeScript promises.
 *
 * The deck and the exports are here for the same reason the boards are, with the
 * failure delayed rather than softened: those are *files*. A field that quietly
 * stops being written renders as a blank slide on someone's projector, or an
 * empty section in a report opened months later — with no server, no log and no
 * way to tell it apart from a report that genuinely had nothing to say.
 *
 * ## What it catches
 *
 * A **removed or renamed** field. The fixture no longer has what the interface
 * requires, and `satisfies` fails at build time rather than rendering
 * `undefined` to a teammate on a tunnel.
 *
 * ## What it does not
 *
 * A field the server **adds**. TypeScript excess-property-checks fresh object
 * literals only, and an imported JSON module is not one. That asymmetry is the
 * right way round: adding a field breaks nothing, removing one breaks a board.
 *
 * A **string-literal union narrowing**, either. TypeScript types every string in
 * an imported JSON as `string`, never as its literal, so `phase: "voting"` reads
 * as `string` and cannot satisfy `PokerPhase`. Hence {@link Widened}, which
 * relaxes exactly that and nothing else. The unions lose nothing by it: every
 * one of them is a server-validated tuple that `scripts/gen_web_types.py` emits
 * into `types/enums.ts` with a `--check` in CI, so they already have a guard,
 * and it is a stronger one than this.
 *
 * Three poker fixtures, not one, because the payload is genuinely phase-shaped.
 * `votes[].value` does not exist while the round is open — vote secrecy is
 * enforced by the field's absence, not by blanking it — and `duel` is null until
 * the floor opens. One fixture would pin one phase and leave the others free.
 *
 * These are also the fixtures every board test should build its state from,
 * rather than hand-rolling a snapshot that can quietly describe a server that
 * does not exist. That is how the join-code bug shipped: two tests, each
 * asserting its own invented contract, agreeing with each other and with
 * nothing else.
