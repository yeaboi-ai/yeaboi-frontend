/**
 * The one button, and the two things a shared primitive can quietly break.
 *
 * Most of this file is not about appearance — CSS Modules hash their class
 * names, so asserting on them measures the build, not the design. What it does
 * measure is the *semantics* the five deleted blocks each got slightly wrong,
 * and which are now everyone's problem the moment they regress:
 *
 * * `type="button"`. Three of the migrated call sites live inside the gate's
 *   `<form>`, where a bare `<button>` submits it. Forgetting the attribute once
 *   in a shared component is forgetting it everywhere.
 * * `aria-pressed`. `active` was previously a colour on four of the five
 *   blocks, so a host who had locked the board was the only person who could
 *   tell — a screen reader was told nothing at all. It must be absent, not
 *   `false`, when the button is not a toggle: `aria-pressed="false"` announces
 *   an unpressed toggle, which a one-shot action is not.
