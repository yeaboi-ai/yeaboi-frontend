/**
 * The one button.
 *
 * There were four, and they had drifted the way four copies always do. Each
 * board grew its own: `castBtn/ghostBtn/saveBtn/addBtn/focusExit` in
 * `retro.module.css`, `cbtn/pkbtn/castBtn` in `poker.module.css`, the deck's
 * bare `.controls button` descendant selector, and `primaryBtn` in
 * `shared.module.css` — plus `IconButton`, which was already the fifth. They
 * agreed on the shape of the idea (min-height `--tap`, `--r-s`, `font:
 * inherit`, `cursor: pointer`) and disagreed on every number: `--panel` or
 * `--panel-2`, `--line` or `--line-strong`, `--fs-2xs` or `--fs-xs` or
 * `--fs-s`. None of the differences meant anything — they were the order the
 * files were written in.
 *
 * ## The axes are the ones the call sites actually use
 *
 * Not a general button API. Each prop below exists because two or more of the
 * deleted blocks needed it and expressed it differently:
 *
 * * `tone` — `default` / `primary` (the accent fill every board's confirm
 *   button had) / `danger` (retro's delete confirmation).
 * * `size` — `s` is the dense in-card register, `m` the ordinary board control,
 *   `l` the page's one call to action (the gate's Open, a modal's Save).
 * * `shape` — `box` is the default; `pill` is the deck's circular nav arrows;
 *   `bare` is retro's card actions, which sit on the card with no chrome of
 *   their own until you touch them.
 * * `active` — sets `aria-pressed`, which the raw buttons mostly forgot. A
 *   control that has locked the board or turned focus mode on is in a state,
 *   and that state was previously visual only.
 * * `emphasis` — the *same* raised look with no `aria-pressed`. Not a
 *   duplicate: `aria-pressed` says "this is a toggle and it is currently on",
 *   so putting it on a control that is not a toggle is a lie a screen reader
 *   reads out. Three call sites need the look without the claim — retro's
 *   one-shot delete confirmation (a question, not a state), the reaction
 *   trigger (which already says `aria-expanded`, and a control that is both
 *   pressed *and* expanded announces twice for one fact), and `CopyField`'s ✓
 *   (transient feedback that clears itself).
 * * `attention` — the poker console's pulse, for the one moment in a round when
 *   everyone has voted and the host is the only thing missing.
 * * `block` — full width, for a button that is the whole row.
 *
 * ## Two deliberate normalisations
 *
 * Unifying five blocks means picking one value where they disagreed, so two
 * call-site registers shift by a hair. Both are recorded rather than hidden:
 *
 * 1. Retro's toolbar controls were `--fs-s` (13.5px) and are now `--fs-xs`
 *    (12.5px), matching poker's console. The smaller value won because poker's
 *    console is a fixed-width bottom sheet where a 1px *growth* can wrap a
 *    label, while retro's toolbar has room either way.
 * 2. `IconButton` was `--panel` / `--line`; the default tone is `--panel-2` /
 *    `--line`, which is what three of the five blocks used. `--panel-2` is
 *    `--panel` with 5% of `--text` mixed in.
 *
 * ## What stays outside
 *
 * Anything that is *mechanics* rather than styling keeps its own class, applied
 * through `className`. Retro's `.grip` is the case that matters: its
 * `touch-action: none` and `cursor: grab` are read by `useCardDrag`, not by a
 * designer, and folding them into a `shape` would make a drag interaction look
 * like a theme decision.
