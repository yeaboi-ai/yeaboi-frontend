/**
 * A card's reactions: the counted ones as chips, the rest behind a picker.
 *
 * Split into three pieces, because putting them together produced the single
 * ugliest thing on the board. The chips row was rendered under every card, and
 * it contained the "add a reaction" trigger — so a card with no reactions, which
 * is most cards, still showed a lone 🙂 floating in empty space below the
 * author line. It read as a rendering fault rather than a control.
 *
 * Now {@link ReactionChips} renders nothing at all when there is nothing to
 * count, and {@link ReactionTrigger} sits in the card's action row with edit,
 * delete and the drag grip — which is where a control belongs and where the eye
 * already goes looking for one.
 *
 * Showing only emoji that already have a count is what keeps cards readable —
 * sixteen zero-count chips per card would be more chrome than content. The tray
 * is a `role="menu"`, so a screen reader announces "menu, 16 items" rather than
 * sixteen loose buttons appearing from nowhere.
 *
 * ## Why {@link ReactionTray} is in the card's flow, not floating over it
 *
 * It used to be `position: absolute`, hanging above the trigger. That looked
 * right in isolation and was broken on the board: `.cards` is `overflow-y: auto`
 * so each column is a scroll box, and a non-`visible` overflow on one axis
 * forces the other to `auto` too — so the column clipped the panel on both
 * axes. In a four-column layout the ~236px panel was wider than its ~250px
 * column allowed for once right-anchored, and all you saw was the last couple
 * of emoji. It was reported, reasonably, as "there are only 2 emojis".
 *
 * A tray in the flow simply cannot be clipped: it pushes the card taller, and
 * the column scrolls to it like any other content. The alternatives were a
 * portal with `getBoundingClientRect` (which is what the pre-React code did,
 * and is only worth its cost when a re-render would otherwise destroy the
 * panel — nothing does that here) or the top-layer `popover` attribute, which
 * the older phones a tunnel link gets opened on do not have.
 *
 * The cost is that the trigger and the tray are no longer one component: the
 * trigger belongs in the action row and the tray belongs below it, so the card
 * owns the open state and renders the two in their two places.
