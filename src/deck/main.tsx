/**
 * Entry for the reporting slide deck.
 *
 * The palette is applied here rather than waiting for React, for the same
 * reason the boards apply their theme before mounting: the document is one
 * file, the script is inline at the end of it, and a browser is free to paint
 * the body before running it. A slide deck opening on the wrong background and
 * then correcting itself is a flash people notice, because the first thing they
 * do with a deck is put it on a projector.
