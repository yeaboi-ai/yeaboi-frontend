/**
 * The deck's persistent furniture: where you are, and how to move.
 *
 * All mono, all `--dim`, all sitting on the edges — a projected slide should be
 * the content and a thin frame that tells a latecomer what they are looking at.
 * The progress indicator is a flat accent rule rather than the two-stop
 * gradient it replaced: a gradient on a 4px bar reads as a smear at the back of
 * a room, and it was the only place in the deck that used one.
