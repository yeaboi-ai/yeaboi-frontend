/**
 * Wrap a rendered region so it can be corrected — when the document is served
 * editable and the payload told us where the field lives.
 *
 * Returns the children untouched otherwise, which is every file on disk. Shared
 * by the report components rather than repeated in each, so adopting editing in
 * one is a one-line change at each call site instead of a branch.
 *
 * It lives beside the primitives and not in `design/` or `shared/`: those are
 * imported by all five bundles, and the edit stack has no business in the four
 * that never render a report.
