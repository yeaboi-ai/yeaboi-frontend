/**
 * The frame every exported report sits in.
 *
 * An export is the one surface where the terminal chrome is not a costume: the
 * file really was produced by a tool someone ran in a terminal, and the header
 * is that tool's mark. (The live boards deliberately do not get it — see
 * `TerminalFrame`.) So the masthead is a window: traffic lights, a title bar
 * reading `yeaboi — <mode>`, and inside it the block-glyph wordmark in the
 * report's own accent.
 *
 * The header carries **facts, not decoration**. Where the old shell had a row
 * of muted metadata strings, each one here is an eyebrow with a label — SOURCE,
 * ANALYZED, ENGINEER — because a report read six months later is exactly the
 * document where "what is this number" is the first question.
 *
 * The theme switcher is the five-swatch picker rather than the old cycle
 * button. Cycling made sense when the control was one `onclick` string in a
 * page with no runtime; with a real component there is no reason to make
 * someone click four times to get from midnight to forest. It prints as
 * nothing, along with the contents nav — both are controls, and a control on
 * paper is furniture that cost a reader ink.
