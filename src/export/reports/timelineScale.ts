 *
 * **Why not a linear axis.** A standup window is mostly empty. Drawn true to
 * scale, a 24-hour window spends half its width on the night and squeezes the
 * hours anyone worked into the remainder. So each event claims a small
 * *footprint* around itself, overlapping footprints merge into **active**
 * segments that get width in proportion to their real duration, and the dead
 * stretches between them become fixed-width **quiet** segments — notches.
 *
 * A compressed axis is no longer linear, which on a time chart is a lie unless
 * the page says so. Every notch carries its own elapsed duration (`Gap.label`)
 * and the component prints a caption whenever `Scale.compressed` is true. Any
 * change here that hides a compression breaks that contract.
